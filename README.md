# Authorships

In projects conducted in Africa, including HIV studies, local researchers are under-represented as authors, especially on the first and last authorship positions. Inequalities in authorships also arise from the gender of the researchers. Women not only tend to publish less, but when they do publish, it is less often as the first or the last author. We assessed authorship trends and publication rates within the articles produced by the Southern Africa region of the IeDEA consortium. 

### Objectives:
1.  Described the distribution of authorship positions per article – by gender and affiliation
2.  Described representation of female and low-income authorships per article position
3.  Showed development of the proportion of female and low-income authorships over time 
4.  Assessed gender and affiliation differences in publishing at the first and last author positions


## Authorship inequalities in IeDEA-SA

### Background
The International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) are a global research consortium of researchers from low-, middle- and high-income countries established in 2006. IeDEA is a highly productive collaboration, having published over 1500 articles. We assessed gender and regional inequalities in publication rates and authorship position among articles produced in 2007-2020 by the Southern Africa region of IeDEA (IeDEA-SA), led by the University of Cape Town, South Africa, and the University of Bern, Switzerland.
### Methods 
We extracted authors’ names and affiliations from 313 published articles acknowledging IeDEA-SA funding, excluding articles with groups listed as authors. We assigned income levels of the authors’ country as indicated in their primary affiliations using the World Bank’s classification. We determined the authors’ gender based on their first names using the US and UK Census databases. We recovered missing values by contacting corresponding authors by email. We compared distributions of authorship positions by gender and country income level. We assessed differences in authorship position (first and last author versus central authorship) by gender and country income level using generalized multinomial regression model with random intercept for authors. 




### Results
### 1. Distribution of authorship positions by gender
### 2. Proportion of female authorships
